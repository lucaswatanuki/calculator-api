# Calculator API with AWS Lambda

This is a very simple project to calculate monthly installments values based on taxes like saving rates (Poupan√ßa) and TR (Taxa Referencial).
The project itself is built to be serverless, running on the cloud by using AWS Lambda funcions and accessible on AWS API Gateway.
